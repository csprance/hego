# HEGo - Houdini Engine in Godot
 
Welcome to the hego repository. This is an open source Houdini Engine integration into Godot as a c++ [GDextension](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/what_is_gdextension.html)

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/peterprickarz/hego/wiki) to get started

This is in heavy WIP and in a really early stage.

I'm taking quite a different approach compared to the offical Houdini Engine plugins(Unreal, Unity, Maya etc), as I mostly focus on keeping interaction with Houdini scriptable, and mainly focus on building a nice API to be used via GDScript.

Currently, this is built for Houdini 20.5.305, and Godot 4.2.2 stable, but should be upwards compatible. When submitting pull requests, please stick to those versions for now.

If you have any questions or problems, feel free to message me on [X](https://x.com/prickarz) where I will try to help as much as I can.
